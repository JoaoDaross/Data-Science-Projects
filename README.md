 # About me :
 
 I am a financial analyst who specializes in data science because I understand that data-based solutions have a strong impact on business. My first contact with data science happened when I worked at a startup accelerator and got to know the routine of a startup that created solutions in machine learning and deep learning.

After that, I started an intensive DS course at Awari School. From this course, I started creating my projects in search of an opportunity in the area of ​​Data Science.
